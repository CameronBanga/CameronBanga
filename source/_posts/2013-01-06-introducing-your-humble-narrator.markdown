Sigh, the first paragraph. I've started a handful of blogs, yet none have had a memorable start from what I can remember, so I'm going to ideally make this post short and sweet. Think of this as the first snowball that will hopefully roll down the hill and become an avalanche. 

While I think my background is rather unimportant, I do think it will be relevant when trying to understand the point of view behind this blog. Through better understanding me, I hope that you will also be able to better understand my posts. 

My name is Cameron Banga, and I am currently serving as lead designer at [9magnets, LLC](http://9magnets.com). I co-founded the company after graduating college in 2010, and we've worked on nearly 100 iPhone, iPad, and Android apps since opening our doors. 

Along the way, I've also written a [book](http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Interface-Cookbook-Cameron-Banga/dp/1849691142) on iOS user interface design and have given a variety of talks on mobile tech and the future of entrepreneurship. When it comes to my personal interests, I really enjoy taking photos with my Canon Rebel T2i, vinyl albums, and soccer.

For this blog, my goal is to lend my opinion on starting a self-sustainable tech company, productivity, improving workflows, design, online data security and anything else that I think I can offer valuable input on. My only goal with each post will be to write something that will help you learn or make you think.

I don't have a tangible idea as to how often I'll post or how long the blog will last. It's more of a personal experiment for myself that I'll be more than happy to share. I suppose I'll write for as long as it feels right, and that's about all I can promise.

Thanks for reading along until the end, I hope you enjoy what you read. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, feel free to reach out whenever via [email](mailto:cameron@cameronbanga.com).
